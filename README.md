## Contribution Guide

- **Thanks for contributing!** To contribute, fork the repo and create a branch:
  - `git checkout -b feature/your-name-description`
- Make focused, well-tested changes and write clear commit messages.
- Follow the existing code style (run formatters: `gofmt` / `prettier` / `black` as applicable).
- Keep pull requests small; add tests or examples when relevant.
- Use conventional commit prefixes like `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:` in messages.
- For large changes, open an issue first to discuss the approach.
- If the project doesn't yet have one, consider adding a Code of Conduct and contribution templates.

If you'd like, I can commit and push this change for you.
