# Two Pointers

The **Two Pointers** pattern is used when we need to iterate over a sequence (array, string, linked list) with **two indices** moving at different speeds/directions.  
This pattern helps in solving problems efficiently without nested loops, reducing time complexity.

## Common Strategies

1. **Start and End Pointers**  
   - One pointer at start, another at end  
   - Move pointers based on condition (e.g., sum, difference)

2. **Slow and Fast Pointers**  
   - Detect cycles or process sequences at different speeds

3. **Sliding Window** (related)  
   - When looking for subarrays / substrings satisfying conditions

## Tips

- Always initialize pointers carefully  
- Decide conditions clearly for moving left/right  
- Check for edge cases: empty array, duplicates, negative numbers
